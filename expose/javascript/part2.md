15. The difference between == and === is that == doesn't do a typecheck, for example, 0 == '0' would give true since is a typecast done. However, 0 === '0' would give false for the opposite reason, there is no type conversation done.
    
17. The result would be [ 2, 4, 6 ]. modifyArray would call [ 1, 2, 3 ] and loop through everything in that array while using the doSomething function which doubles whatever number in the parameter. The for loop does this for everything in the array and returns [ 2, 4, 6 ].

19. The output gives "1\n4\n3\n2"
